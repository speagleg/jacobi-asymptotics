## 0. Status

| Result | Statement | Label |
|---|---|---|
| K | second difference of G(n) := Σ_{j<n}(n−j)u_j over ±h = triangle-kernel sum of u, of total mass h² | PROVED |
| **G1-T** | H_all + (T3) slow oscillation of β_n ⇒ β_n → 1, i.e. n^p b_n → c(p)C | PROVED-mod-cite (G2 (P)) |
| **G1-L** | H_all + a one-sided bound (sup β_n < ∞ or inf β_n > 0) ⇒ (1/n)Σ_{j≤n} log(j^p b_j) → log(c(p)C) | PROVED-mod-cite (G2 (P)) |
| A1 | J ≥ 0 ⇒ sine-weighted window averages of a_j are ≥ 2cos(π/(L+1))·min b over the window. Hence, if b is regular, liminf of window averages of a_j/(2b_j) ≥ 1 | PROVED |
| G1-R | (T3) from the atoms alone; the upper half of a_n ~ 2b_n | GAP (see §4) |

Setting:
- J > 0 is the Jacobi matrix of σ = Σ w_k δ_{x_k}, with x_k = f(k) regularly spaced with index −p and constant C
  (item 11 (H-a)).
- The weights satisfy Σw < ∞ and w_k ≥ c₁k^{−s}. These are the hypotheses of G2's Theorem H_all, so H_all applies.
- Put β_j := j^p b_j/(c(p)C), u_j := log β_j and G(n) := Σ_{j=1}^{n−1}(n−j)u_j.
- H_all is equivalent to G(n) = o(n²) (G2 PROOF.md §3: its b_j form, with the Stirling-type identity).

## 1. The kernel identity

**Lemma K.** For integers n > h ≥ 1, G(n+h) − 2G(n) + G(n−h) = Σ_j (h − |j − n|)⁺ u_j, and Σ_{m∈ℤ}(h − |m|)⁺ = h².

*Proof.* G(n) = Σ_j (n − j)⁺u_j. For fixed j, the second difference in n of (n − j)⁺ with step h is the triangle
(h − |n − j|)⁺. This is checked by cases on the sign of n − j ± h. ∎

## 2. Tauberian reductions

**Theorem G1-T.** Assume H_all's hypotheses and

  (T3) ω(δ) := limsup_{n→∞} sup_{n≤m≤(1+δ)n} |β_m/β_n − 1| → 0 as δ ↓ 0.

Then β_n → 1, i.e. n^p b_n → c(p)C. No bound on β_n, no a_n hypothesis and no monotonicity are assumed.

*Proof.*
1. **(T3) gives a two-sided additive modulus.** For m ∈ [(1−δ)n, n] we have n ≤ (1 + δ/(1−δ))m. So for all
   |m − n| ≤ δn, |u_m − u_n| ≤ ω̃(δ) + o(1), where ω̃(δ) := −log(1 − ω(δ/(1−δ))) → 0.
2. **Window average.** Fix δ ∈ (0, ½) and put h := ⌊δn⌋. By Lemma K,

     u_n = h⁻²[G(n+h) − 2G(n) + G(n−h)] − h⁻² Σ_j (h − |j−n|)⁺(u_j − u_n).

   The first term is o(n²)/(δn)² → 0, because G(m) = o(m²) and n ± h ≍ n. The second is at most ω̃(δ) + o(1) in
   absolute value, by step 1 and because the kernel has mass h².
3. **Conclusion.** limsup |u_n| ≤ ω̃(δ) for every δ. Let δ → 0. ∎

*Compared with item 11's Theorem C′.* C′ needed (T1)–(T4) and Wiener's Tauberian theorem, and gave β_n → 1 only under
monotonicity (T4). G1-T needs only (T3), because H_all (G2) already supplies the averaged statement for every p.
Numerically, (T4) fails for parity-oscillating weights (`check_regularity.out`) while (T3) appears to hold
asymptotically. So the reduction is a genuine improvement. The b_n half of G1 is now equivalent to (T3), given H_all.
Conversely, β_n → 1 implies (T3) trivially.

**Theorem G1-L (single Cesàro mean).** Assume H_all's hypotheses and sup_n β_n < ∞ (or inf_n β_n > 0). Then
(1/n)Σ_{j<n} u_j → 0, i.e. the geometric mean of j^p b_j/(c(p)C) over j < n tends to 1.

*Proof (Landau).* Assume u_j ≤ M; the case u_j ≥ −M is symmetric. Put A(n) := Σ_{j<n}u_j, so that
G(n+1) − G(n) = A(n+1).
- Since u ≤ M, we have A(n+i) ≤ A(n) + Mi. Summing over i = 1…h gives
  G(n+h+1) − G(n+1) ≤ hA(n) + Mh(h+1)/2. So
  A(n) ≥ [G(n+h+1) − G(n+1)]/h − M(h+1)/2.
- Similarly A(n−i) ≥ A(n) − Mi gives A(n) ≤ [G(n+1) − G(n−h+1)]/h + M(h+1)/2.
- Take h = ⌊δn⌋. Then G = o(n²) gives |A(n)|/n ≤ o(1)/δ + Mδ/2 + o(1). Let δ → 0. ∎

## 3. The a_n side

**Proposition A1 (positivity, windowed).** Let J ≥ 0. Let n ≥ 1 and L ≥ 2, and put s_j := sin(π(j − n + 1)/(L + 1))
for n ≤ j < n + L. Then

  Σ_{j=n}^{n+L−1} a_j s_j² ≥ 2cos(π/(L+1))·(min_{n≤j<n+L−1} b_j)·Σ_j s_j².

In particular, assume b is regular on windows: max_{n≤j<n+L_n}|b_j/b_n − 1| → 0 for some L_n → ∞. This holds when
β_n → 1 (G1-T) and L_n = o(n). Then liminf_n Σ_j (a_j/(2b_j)) s_j²/Σ_j s_j² ≥ 1.

*Proof.* Take v_j := (−1)^j s_j on the window and 0 elsewhere. Then
0 ≤ ⟨v, Jv⟩ = Σ a_j s_j² − 2Σ_j b_j s_j s_{j+1}. The sine vector satisfies s_{j−1} + s_{j+1} = 2cos(π/(L+1))s_j, with
zero boundary values (item 11 (S4); Lean `toeplitz_eigen`). So Σ_j s_j s_{j+1} = cos(π/(L+1))Σ s_j², and s ≥ 0
gives Σ b_j s_j s_{j+1} ≥ (min b)·cos(π/(L+1))Σ s_j². ∎

A1 is the windowed, limit-free form of item 11's Lemma P: a_n ≥ 2b_n on average. The matching upper bound
(limsup ≤ 1) is the remaining a_n gap; see §4.
